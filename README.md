# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game!

This game allows you to play rock, paper, scissors with a bot on the computer, in case you have no one to play with. Simply choose your weapon, and you will get a message on the game result.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

First, I created the HTML and organized the sections, and buttons I needed to create the game. Next, I went to JavaScript and created the functions to let the bot choose a random weapon, using random generated numbers. I used conditionals to allow the player to win or not depending on that weapons the bot and the player chooses. After that, I used CSS to design the page like a carnical game show. Still keeping it pretty simple, I added the forever alone meme since it felt fitting for this game vs a computer.

## Lessons Learned:

This was definitely one of my first projects using JavaScript which was a little more complex as well. It helped me get more of an understanding of the syntax and how it can work to generate a game like this.
